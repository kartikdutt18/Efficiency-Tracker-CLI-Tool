### Tool To Track Your Efficiency in Tasks using CLI

Requirements :
```
python > 2.7
pandas
argparser
matplotlib
```
Goal :
Add tasks using CLI using the following commands :
```
python3 $EfficiencyCLI tasks_done tasks_completed look_back
```

Lookback is optional.
Also, you can set the default tasks_completed so you don't have to pass it again.

Result will be along the following lines.

I am not sure if this is of any use to others but if you do use it, leave a star. For any problem / feature requests open an issue.
